    <h2>A Random Story</h2>
    <p>When Eliza inherited her grandmother’s creaky old house on the edge of town, <br>
        she wasn’t expecting much. A few dusty rooms, maybe some old photo albums, <br>
        and the lingering scent of lavender and mothballs. What she didn’t expect <br>
        was the lamp. <br>
        She found it in the attic on her second night there—a tall, <br>
        Art Deco floor lamp, tucked behind a stack of forgotten Christmas decorations <br>
        and boxes labeled “DO NOT OPEN.” Naturally, she opened them. <br>
        The lamp didn’t have a bulb. Instead, it held a glowing marble suspended in <br>
        a spiral of brass wires. It wasn’t connected to anything, and yet it pulsed faintly, <br>
        like a heartbeat. When Eliza touched it, she swore she heard a whisper—not quite a word, <br>
        but a suggestion. A feeling. <br>
        That night, her dreams were different. Vivid. She saw the house as it <br>
        used to be, full of life and music and people in elegant clothes. <br>
        Her grandmother was there, younger than Eliza had ever seen her, <br>
        standing beside the lamp. She was smiling... and whispering to it. <br>
        In the morning, the attic was warmer. Brighter. And the lamp? Still glowing, <br>
        just a little more. Eliza never figured out what powered it, or why <br>
        it whispered, or why—every time she had a question—it seemed to show her <br>
        the answer in a dream. But she stopped wondering after a while. <br>
        She just kept the lamp near her reading chair, and every now and then, she'd whisper back.

    <p>I started at BCIT in September 2023 right after I graduated from highschool. <br>
    I enrolled in the Graphic Design program, because I want to learn how to make some cool designs.</p>
